            <p class="overview-txt">Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era that we are living in. Therefore, if society is to achieve quick economic advancements and fully benefit from information technology, 
               computer science education is essential. The study and creation of programs that enable us to use computers on a daily basis, the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures employed to create applications and systems that function dependably, accurately,
               and morally are all included in computer science.
               Employers who recruit computer scientists demand competent programmers with knowledge of modern techniques and tools as well as the ability to apply good engineering concepts to the development, production,
               and maintenance of their products. Computer programming is at the core of computer science.</p>

            <p class="vision-txt">Imagine a time when each and every byte of code is a work of art.
              That's how we see it. We want to be more than just teachers; 
              we want to be the masters leading the bleeding edge of computing education like a symphony.

                Creativity is a need in our labs, not a luxury. Imagine a community where virtual reality serves as a classroom,
                hackathons are commonplace, and creative ideas are translated into workable solutions. 
                The next generation of tech pioneers will grow up in this environment.
